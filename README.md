# Introduction  

Hello! This is a beginner project game made using _Python_ and _pygame_ library. It was heavily inspired by Sentdex. I hope you like what you see here and enjoy **_THE GAME!_**  

**Warning**: The following is a work in progress and a beginner trying to understand stuff.  

Here you go!

## Features  

**THE GAME** features the following functionalities (_and with many more to come, of course!_):
> * A counter to count no. of objects dodged
> * Background sounds including crash sound & gameplay music
> * Button functions
> * Pause menu to resume or quit the game (PRESS **'p'** to _PAUSE_ THE GAME) 
> * Most importantly, this game features my dog **_POLO_** starring as the _icon_! (Seriously, what more do you want now?)

The **MENU SCREEN** & **PAUSE SCREEN** was also made later so that the game doesn't just simply.._Begin_. They serve as a UI for the user.

The **CRASHED SCREEN** was also developed with text being displayed as "_You Crashed_" when the car object hits the blue block(s) or even the side of the 800 x 600 screen.  
A sound is also generated during the crash which can be heard when playing the game.

>The project is incomplete in the sense that I plan on to make the following modifications in the near future:-
>  * Add background
>  * Add complex crash functionality like fires & smoke
>  * Add better sounds
