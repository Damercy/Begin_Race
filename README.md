# Introduction  

Hello! This is a beginner project game made using _Python_ and _pygame_ library. It was heavily inspired by Sentdex. I hope you like what you see here and enjoy **_THE GAME!_**  

**Warning**: The following is a work in progress and a beginner trying to understand stuff.  

Here you go!

## Features  

**THE GAME** features the following functionalities (_and with many more to come, of course!_):
> * A counter to count no. of objects dodged
> * An incrementally increasing level as you progress through the game
> * Background sounds including crash sound & gameplay music
> * Button functions
> * Pause menu to resume or quit the game (PRESS **'p'** to _PAUSE_ THE GAME) 
> * Most importantly, this game features my dog **_POLO_** starring as the _icon_! (Seriously, what more do you want now?)

The **MENU SCREEN** & **PAUSE SCREEN** was also made later so that the game doesn't just simply.._Begin_. They serve as a UI for the user.

The **CRASHED SCREEN** was also developed with text being displayed as "_You Crashed_" when the car object hits the blue block(s) or even the side of the 800 x 600 screen.  
A sound is also generated during the crash which can be heard when playing the game.

# HOW TO PLAY

The objective of the game is simple ---- To AVOID getting crashed!  

The Car only moves sideways, so to move left , press the **left arrow** (<img src="https://image.freepik.com/free-icon/big-arrow-left_318-10938.jpg" width=10px height=10px>) on your keyboard and similarly, press   **right arrow** (<img src="https://www.colourbox.com/preview/32597694-right-side-arrow.jpg" width=10px height=10px>) to move right.  

Also avoid hitting the edges of the screen (window) to avoid crashing.  

Keep on playing and dodging objects. For every _10_ objects you surpass , the speed of the car automatically increases thereby >  increasing the difficulty. 

 Press 'p' to pause the game.

## HOW TO CLONE AND START PLAYING  

Simply clone this repository and in the local copy in your machine , open the folder that corresponds to the directory '**THE GAME**'. 
Or in other words, move to this location : '[Your download path here]\Begin_Race\The GAME  
>
Then click the **game.exe** file to start the game.  
>
For modifications to the game files including changing FPS from the current 60FPS,or to add your own sound files/icons/image sprites or any change whatsoever, open the file **Game.py** in the downloaded repo and modify this **.py** file as required.
>
Hope you like it!

## Additional Thoughts

>The project is incomplete in the sense that I plan on to make the following modifications in the near future:-
>  * Add background
>  * Add complex crash functionality like fires & smoke
>  * Add better sounds
>  * Make it cool in ways I _can_ imagine in the future!
